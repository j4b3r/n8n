ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm j4b3r, a DevOps engineer who loves automation and open-source tools. I've recently started learning and working with n8n, and I created this repo to share useful templates that I build along the way.

ðŸ“‚ About This Repo

This repository contains n8n templates Iâ€™ve createdâ€”starting with a workflow that automatically updates Docker containers with manual approval.

Feel free to explore, use, or improve them!
If you need help building a workflow, just send me an email at 0cold.silence0@gmail.com â€” happy to connect!
